Ragel Examples for Go
=====================

These examples serve the following purposes:

- Help you learn Ragel
- Test the correctness of the code I wrote for Ragel
- Benchmark Ragel's performance on your machine
- And hopefully give you some code you can steal ;]

To get started you should first ``make install`` ragel.  Then navigate
to this directory and run::

    make

To automatically compile/test/benchmark these examples.  If you're on
a 32-bit platform, you'll need to edit the Makefile and change all the
'6' characters to '8'.

The following examples are provided:

- atoi.rl: Convert string to integer (very simple)
- rpn.rl: Reverse polish notation calculator (simple)
- url.rl: Very fast and robust HTTP/SIP URL parser (very complicated)

To see graphviz diagrams of the state machines generated by Ragel in
these examples, run the following commands::

    sudo apt-get install graphviz evince
    make graph

Those diagrams (along with the pdf manual) are super important for
troubleshooting and simplifying your Ragel code.

If Ragel accidentally outputs code that looks like C, it probably
means I forgot to override a function or two inside:
``ragel/goipgoto.cpp``.

I truly hope these examples help you in your personal and professional
endeavors.  If you have any questions my email is: jtunney@gmail.com
